# C Programming at SBU ⚡

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my C programming coursework repository for **Shahid Beheshti University** (Electrical Engineering, Year 1).

**Using this repo, you can follow along and start learning C from the basics with real university exercises!**  
Perfect for beginners, classmates, or anyone refreshing their C skills 😊

I'm **Sava**, and this is my first serious programming course. I'm learning everything from pointers and memory management to writing clean, efficient code — all while getting closer to hardware!

### Repository Structure
- `Homework-XX/` → Assigned homework problems from the professor  
  (Includes problem statement, my solution, and sample outputs)
- `Class-Session-XX/` → Code examples written by the TA or professor during class

### Why This Repo Exists
- To keep all my work organized and version-controlled
- To document my learning journey (including comments and explanations)
- To build a clean portfolio
- To help others who are taking the same course

### Feel free to:

- ⭐ Star the repo if you're learning C too!
- Open an issue if you have questions, better solutions, or suggestions
- Fork it and try the problems yourself
