# Example 02 - Inverted Star Triangle

**What we did in class:**
The TA demonstrated how to use nested loops to print patterns, specifically an **inverted (right-aligned decreasing) triangle** made of asterisks (*).

### **Problem:**
- Read an integer n from the user
- Print n lines where:
  - The first line has n stars
  - The second line has n-1 stars
  - ...
  - The last line has 1 star

### **Sample Run:**

#### Input: 5

#### Output:
*****
****
***
**
*

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Nested for loops (outer for rows, inner for columns)
- Decreasing loop counters
- Basic pattern printing – common in introductory programming

**File:** `inverted_triangle.c` contains the exact code written by the TA in class.
