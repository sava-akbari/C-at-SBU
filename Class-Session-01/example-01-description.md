# Example 01 - Average and Second Largest Number

**What we did in class:**
The TA wrote a single program that:
- Reads a sequence of integers from the user until 0 is entered
- Calculates and prints the **average** of the numbers
- Finds and prints the **second largest** number in the sequence

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Loop with sentinel value (-1)
- Tracking sum and count for average
- Keeping track of largest and second largest numbers
- Handling edge cases (less than 2 numbers, no numbers, duplicates)

### **Sample Run:**
Input:
3 5 7 2 8 8 4 1 0

Output:
Average is : 4.75
Second Largest number is: 7
